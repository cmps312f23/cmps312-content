    - To inherit from a class, write the name of the base class after a colon.
    - There are two things to keep in mind when inheriting:
        1. If the child class has a primary constructor, then the parent class
            must be initialized using the parameters of the primary constructor.
        2. If the child class has no primary constructor, then each secondary
            constructor has to initialize the base type using the 'super' keyword.
